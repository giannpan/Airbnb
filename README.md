# üè† Airbnb

Tourism is Greece‚Äôs most important economic activity, accounting for at least a fifth of the country‚Äôs economy. In that frame, the short - term rental market is booming in Greece with an estimated 13000 properties in Athens available to visitors via Airbnb, while in the summer of 2015, there were just 2,000 properties listed on the specific platform. Also this industry is calculated to generate 3.3 billion euros annually into the Greek economy.

However the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has brought about a paradigm shift, not only in the accommodation sector but also in the lives of local residents. The surge has led to soaring rents, a phenomenon causing families to grapple with housing challenges.

Greece, mirroring its European counterparts, is tightening the reins on short-term rentals. A significant shift includes the imposition of more stringent regulations, wherein individual owners with more than three short-term lease properties are required to initiate a business activity.
